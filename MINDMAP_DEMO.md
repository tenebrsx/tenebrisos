# ðŸ§  Mindmap Feature Demo

Welcome to the **Mindmap** feature - your cognitive sandbox for nonlinear thinking!

## What is the Mindmap?

The Mindmap is not your traditional organizational tool. Instead, it's a **free-floating canvas** where you can:
- Scatter thoughts and ideas like objects on a desk
- Move blocks around freely without constraints
- Engage with your thoughts spatially and visually
- Create connections through proximity and positioning

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Access the Mindmap
1. Look for the **Brain icon** (ðŸ§ ) in the bottom navigation
2. Tap/click to enter your cognitive sandbox

### Create Your First Block
- **Double-click anywhere** on the canvas to create a new mind block
- Start typing immediately - your thoughts flow directly onto the canvas
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to save, or `Escape` to cancel

## âœ¨ Core Features

### Block Management
- **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag any block to reposition it freely
- **Edit Content**: Double-click any block to edit its text
- **Right-click Menu**: Access advanced options for each block

  - `f`: Fit all blocks in view
  - `g`: Toggle grid display
  - `Space`: Pan mode (hold and drag)

### Mood Tags & Focus Weight
Each block can be tagged with:
- **Mood Tags**: Neutral, Positive, Negative, Idea, Important, Question
- **Focus Weight**: 1-5 scale indicating importance/urgency
- Visual indicators appear as colored bars and dots

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Features

### Statistics Panel
Track your thinking patterns:
- Total blocks created
- Blocks created today
- Average focus weight
- Mood tag distribution

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### For Brainstorming
1. Start with a central concept in the middle
2. Let ideas flow naturally around it
3. Use spatial relationships to show connections
4. Don't worry about organization - embrace chaos!

### For Problem Solving
1. Scatter different aspects of the problem
2. Use mood tags to categorize (red for obstacles, green for solutions)
3. Adjust focus weights to prioritize
4. Move related blocks closer together

### For Creative Thinking
1. Use the full canvas space
2. Mix text with positioning to create meaning
3. Let blocks "collide" and see what emerges
4. Export snapshots of different thinking sessions

## ðŸ”„ Data Persistence

- **Auto-save**: All changes are automatically saved to local storage
- **Export**: Download your mindmap as JSON for backup
- **Import**: Load previously exported mindmaps
- **Cross-session**: Your mindmaps persist between browser sessions

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

The mindmap follows the app's **dark aesthetic**:
- Glass morphism effects with subtle transparency
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded mood indicators
- Responsive to zoom and interaction
- Noise texture overlay for depth

## ðŸ”„ Integration

The mindmap integrates seamlessly with the rest of Tenebris OS:
- Matches the overall dark theme
- Uses the same navigation patterns
- Follows the app's animation language
- Respects the same keyboard shortcuts

## ðŸš¨ Tips for Maximum Flow

1. **Don't overthink**: The canvas is meant for stream-of-consciousness
2. **Use space meaningfully**: Distance can represent relationships
3. **Color code your thoughts**: Use mood tags to create visual patterns
4. **Zoom out regularly**: Get the big picture of your thinking
5. **Export important sessions**: Save breakthrough moments

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

Potential features being considered:
- Connecting lines between blocks
- Block grouping and clustering
- Template mindmaps for common use cases
- Collaborative real-time editing
- AI-powered block suggestions
- Voice-to-block creation

**Remember**: This is your cognitive sandbox. There are no rules, no wrong ways to use it. Let your thoughts flow freely and see what emerges! ðŸŒŸ
