# Tenebris OS - Brutalist Mobile Design Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Tenebris OS as a native iOS application using React Native with a brutalist design aesthetic. The design draws inspiration from high-contrast, functional interfaces that prioritize clarity and directness over decorative elements.

## Design Philosophy

### Brutalist Principles Applied

1. **Raw Functionality Over Decoration**
   - Clean, geometric shapes with no rounded corners on cards
   - High contrast color combinations
   - Typography as a visual element (uppercase text throughout)
   - Minimal use of shadows or gradients

2. **Bold Color Palette**
   - Pure black background (`#000000`)
   - High-contrast accent colors:
     - Electric Yellow (`#FFD700`) - For campaigns and highlights
     - Neon Green (`#00FF7F`) - For activities and positive actions
     - Hot Pink (`#FF1493`) - For meetings and urgent items
     - Cyan Blue (`#00BFFF`) - For calls and information
     - Electric Purple (`#8A2BE2`) - For secondary actions

3. **Typography as Design Element**
   - All-caps text for headers and labels
   - Bold, sans-serif fonts
   - Text as functional communication, not decoration

## Architecture

### Component System

We implemented a modular brutalist widget system with the following components:

#### Core Widgets

## Color Coding System

### Activity Type Mapping
- **Marketing/Leads:** `#00FF7F` (Neon Green)
- **Campaign Work:** `#FFD700` (Electric Yellow)
- **Meetings:** `#FF1493` (Hot Pink)
